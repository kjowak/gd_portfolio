                                        The Wall is a game inspired by Tetris. It involves clicking blocks as they light up to turn them off, a bomb ability
                                        that turns off all lights on the board, a speeding-up mechanic, and a leaderboard that keeps track of a player's high score.

                                                The Wall, being created back in 2017, was my first game that I completed, thanks to its small scope after burning
                                                out on many projects before that were way too ambitious for a 14-year-old kid, let alone a single developer. Although
                                                I had been developing the skills I used on the project, such as using ClickDetectors and reading user input, in previous projects,
                                                I had never put them all together into a singular, cohesive system.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                This was also my very first experience using RemoteEvents,
                                                one of Roblox's Networking methods between the client and the server. The whole concept of the client-server model
                                                was hard for my 14-year-old brain to wrap around, but I persevered and eventually understood it enough to make the game work.
                                                The game also features my very first attempt at using Roblox's Leaderboard mechanic. I used it to keep track of how long 
                                                the player had been alive for, and to keep track of the player's longest run.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                At first glance, the game doesn't look very challenging. And it isn't, but it was supposed to be. I tried to add
                                                challenge to the game by having the squares gradually speed up, shortening the time it takes for them to light up.
                                                The idea was to have them grow so fast that the player would be forced to use the bomb, which would then provide some sort
                                                of reset to the squares' speed. However, it would never reset to the starting pace, meaning that eventually the player would
                                                have to rely on their hand-eye coordination to make it when the speed was high enough. My lack of knowledge of object-oriented programming
                                                made this a very tough task. While the system is present in the game, the bomb resets the speed back to 0 and is therefore
                                                too powerful, meaning the player could essentially go forever.
                                            </p>

                                                Despite its shortcomings and poor design, I do believe The Wall is a good representation
                                                of where I came from as a game developer and programmer. It is still functional despite Roblox updates,
                                                and is available for playing on my Roblox profile <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.roblox.com/games/932467286/The-Wall">here</a>.
