									<p>
										Star Wars Simulator was a game my friends and I wanted to create over the Summer of 2023. The end goal was to have a game
										where players could immerse themselves in the world of Star Wars, playing as an anonymous citizen of the galaxy. Players
										would have the freedom to choose whatever path they wanted to take in their journey, whether it be unlocking the jetpack
										and famous DL-44 blaster to become a bounty hunter, or focusing on gaining experience to become a master of the force (or both!).
									</p>
									<p>
										The game would feature a two-track structure to progression, with guns and utilities, such as the jetpack, being unlockable
										through credits, and force abilities and lightsabers being unlockable through experience. Players could earn credits by
										completing quests, finding and selling randomly-generated scrap, or killing players with a bounty on their heads. Experience
										would also be obtained through quests, although at a much less accessible rate than credits. Quests that rewarded experience
										would be more in line with the lore behind the Jedi and Sith in Star Wars.
									</p>
									<p>
										As you can imagine, and as my friends and I quickly found out, a game of this magnitude would require a lot of time 
										and dedication to complete in a single summer, especially with myself as the only programmer on the team. Unfortunately,
										my friends and I didn't have enough time to see our project come even close to a complete product. However, I am very proud
										of the prototype systems I created for the project, and would like to highlight a few of them.
									</p>
									<h2><u>Force Abilities</u></h2>
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/ForcePush.gif" alt="Clip of Force Push Ability" /></span>
										The first system I'd like to show off is the force ability system I created for the game. The Force system takes input from
										the player's keyboard (in its current state, the keys are tied to E and F). This input then signals to the server that a
										player is trying to use a force ability. The server then gets that player's respective Player class object to check that
										they have enough experience to use the ability. If they do, it then puts the player on cooldown, calls the respective Force 
										function, and signals back to the client that it should play an animation.
									</p>

									<p>
										Currently, the only 2 abilities in the game are the Force Push and Pull. This is largely due to them being similar to implement,
										and in fact all I did to implement the pull after implementing the push was add a negative sign to the impulse value. That's not
										to say that the functions are simple, however. Due to the way Roblox manages Network Ownership of parts, special care must be
										taken when the physics for a part are owned by a player instead of the server. In the case of a force ability, this would be a
										very common occurance, since players gain ownership of parts that are near their character.
									</p>

									<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/ForcePullOnPlayer.gif" alt="Clip of player force pulling another player" /></span>
										The way I chose to implement this was to have the server perform a boxcast for a region in front of the character.
										The results of that boxcast are then parsed, checking for any BaseParts whose assemblies haven't already been pushed/pulled.
										Each BasePart is also checked to see if it's a part of another player's character, since the force applied for an assembly
										with a Humanoid needs to be different from the force applied on a non-Humanoid assembly due to how Roblox handles Humanoid physics.
										The Network Owner of each part is found, and if the owner is a player, that player's client is signaled to apply a force to the
										part in question (and its assembly if it has one).
									</p>

									<p>
										I'm very happy with how these two abilties turned out, despite me not fulling fleshing out the ability system.
										If I were to keep developing this system, I think I'd start by adding a server-sided check to make sure clients
										aren't applying an outrageous amount of force to parts or, more seriously, other players.
									</p>
