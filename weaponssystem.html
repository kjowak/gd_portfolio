										Arguably the most popular genre of games are shooter games, so I figured I had to try my hand at creating one of my own.
										While I by no means created a full-fleshed shooter game with rounds or any objective for that matter, I have created
										some pretty flushed-out shooter systems that make adding various types of weapons a breeze and designer-friendly.
									</p>

									<h2><u>The Weapon Factory</u></h2>
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/WeaponFactoryFiring.gif" alt="" /></span>
										I began the challenge of trying to create a weapon system in the summer of 2020, when I was commissioned by a few people
										to script some guns for their games in exchange for Robux, Roblox's virtual currency. This would be my first time attempting
										to code guns without a tutorial, and to be honest felt a bit in over my head. However, I was determined to at least come up with
										some sort of functional product, especially since it'd been something I'd wanted to try for a while, but just couldn't build
										up the courage to do.
									</p>
									<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/WeaponFactoryAnimations.gif" alt="" /></span>
										The first thing I tried to get working was the client input, which I usually look to first when creating these kinds of
										systems, since doing so usually helps rule out client-side questions when debugging. To receive input, such as when the player
										clicks their mouse, I set up a script that detects when a weapon with a certain tag is equipped/unequipped. When it's equipped,
										the script then connects the mouse button down event to a function that will signal the server, as well as handle any UI changes
										that need to be made and client-side effects. An event is also tied to when the player presses the "R" key and a function that, once
										again, signals the server and handles any client-sided calculations that are needed.
									</p>

									<p>
										Once I got that working, I moved to the server and created a script that keeps track of all of the guns in the game,
										mapping them to their respective owners (players). This allowed me to perform all of the essential calculations in a
										secure way such that exploiters won't be able to, say, give themselves unlimited ammo in a clip, or max out the damage
										done by their weapon. This is because any changes made to the Gun's configs on the client side aren't replicated to the
										server or any other clients.
									</p>

									<p>
										Both the client and the server have access to a Gun class, which is where the bulk of the system's code lies. This class
										has methods such as Gun:Reload(), which handles reloading the gun, and Gun:Fire(), which (big surprise) handles firing the gun.
										While the code is varied slightly from client to server,
										the majority of the code is the same, which allowed me to essentially keep 2 copies of each gun - one on the client, and on the server.
										This made it fairly straightforward to implement certain functionalities, such as updating the player's GUI and animating the player, that otherwise would've
										needed special care if I had only kept a copy on the server.
									</p>

									<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/ExampleConfigFolder.jpg" alt="Example gun configuration file" /></span>
										To make adding new weapons into the game a lot easier, I took advantage of the modular design of the system and created a
										uniform configuration file that is placed into every weapon. That file is then read by the Gun constructor when creating
										the Gun object, and the appropriate variables are then set. This makes changing the feel of guns <strong>extremely</strong>
										fast and intuitive, making the weapon design process a walk in the park.
									</p>

									<p>
										I also created all of the animations for the system using Roblox's built in animation editor, which I found very useful for
										creating quick animations.
									</p>

									<p>
										Fortunately, this is one of the few select projects that I have open to the public for playing; if you'd like a
										playthrough, you can find the Roblox experience
